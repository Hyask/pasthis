# *Pasthis*

## Stupid Simple Pastebin
Pasthis is a simple pastebin written in [php](https://www.php.net/)
and using [sqlite](https://sqlite.org/) as database backend.

## Specifications:
  - Pasthis MUST supports color highlighting
  - Pasthis SHOULD be able to work without JS if necessary
  - Pasthis MUST be lightweight
  - Pasthis MUST NOT use clunky-javascript-powered-crypo
  - Pasthis SHOULD NOT use predictable (by a casual attacker) pastes url
  - Pasthis MUST deter trivial spam attacks
  - Pasthis MUST have a way to delete outdated pastes without user intervention
  - Pasthis MUST allow the user to see the raw content
  - Pasthis MUST NOT store users IP in plain-text
  - Pasthis MUST NOT depend on external services

## Implementation
### Anti-spam
Every time a paste is sent, a value (called degree) is associated to
the poster's ip hash. It is used in the followind formula:

    T = time() + intval(pow(degree, 2.5))

If the user posts another paste after T, the degree is reset to zero.
If sÂ·he tries before T, the degree is incremented, and the paste is denied.

There is also an hidden field, that set the degree is set to 512 (Which corresponds
to ~72h) if filled.


### Display
The user can access the raw version of a paste by appending
@raw to its id.

## Deployment
1. Download [pasthis](https://github.com/jvoisin/pasthis)
2. Put it in a directory on your webserver
3. Use the [.htaccess](https://github.com/jvoisin/pasthis/blob/master/.htaccess)
or the [nginx](https://github.com/jvoisin/pasthis/blob/master/nginx.conf) depending of
your configuration
4. Make sure that the folder is _readable_ and _writable_ by www-data, since this is
required by php to be able to create the sqlite database.
